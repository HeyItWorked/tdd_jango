Class-based views
    1. Add an import:  from other_app.views import Home
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  url(r'^$', Home.as_view(), name='home')
Including another URLconf
    1. Import the include() function: from django.conf.urls import url, include
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  url(r'^blog/', include('blog.urls'))

A url entry starts with a regular expression that defines which URLs it applies to, and
goes on to say where it should send those requests—either to a view function you’ve
imported, or maybe to another urls.py file somewhere else

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^$', views.home_page, name='home'),
]
